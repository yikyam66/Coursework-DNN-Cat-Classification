# Coursework-DNN-Cat-Classification

## Project Description

This project implements a deep neural network for image classification, specifically to distinguish between cat and non-cat images. It's part of a programming assignment from the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course, which is likely part of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a two-layer neural network
- Implementation of an L-layer deep neural network
- Application of the neural network to cat vs non-cat image classification
- Comparison of performance between the two models

## Contents

The main file in this project is `Deep Neural Network - Application.ipynb`, which contains:

1. Package imports and dataset loading
2. Implementation of a two-layer neural network
3. Implementation of an L-layer deep neural network
4. Training and evaluation of both models
5. Analysis of results
6. Optional section for testing the model with your own images

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- h5py
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- SciPy

## Notes

- This project is part of an educational course and is meant for learning purposes.
- The dataset used is a "Cat vs non-Cat" dataset provided in the course.
- The model aims to improve upon the 70% test accuracy achieved by a logistic regression model in a previous assignment.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different network architectures
- Try different hyperparameters to improve model performance
- Apply the model to different image classification tasks
